      There is also the ability to view the publications as a diagram, if you

    <P class="mb-3">
      If you click on a card, which represents a 30040 index event, the
      associated reading view opens to the publication. The app then pulls all
      of the content events (30041s and 30818s for wiki pages), in the order in
      which they are indexed, and displays them as a single document.
    </P>

    <P class="mb-3">
      Each content section (30041 or 30818) is also a level in the table of
      contents, which can be accessed from the floating icon top-left in the
      reading view. This allows for navigation within the publication.
      Publications of type "blog" have a ToC which emphasizes that each entry
      is a blog post.
      
      (This functionality has been temporarily disabled, but the TOC is visible.)

    <Heading tag="h3" class="h-leather mb-3">For e-books</Heading>

    <P class="mb-3">
      The most common use for Alexandria is for e-books: both those the users
      have written themselves and those uploaded to Nostr from other sources.
      The first minor version of the app, Gutenberg, is focused on displaying
      and producing these publications.
    </P>

    <P class="mb-3">
      An example of a book is <A
        href="/publication?d=jane-eyre-an-autobiography-by-charlotte-bront%C3%AB-v-3rd-edition"
        >Jane Eyre</A
      >

    </div>

    <Heading tag="h3" class="h-leather mb-3">For scientific papers</Heading>

    <P class="mb-3">
      Alexandria will also display research papers with Asciimath and LaTeX
      embedding, and the normal advanced formatting options available for
      Asciidoc. In addition, we will be implementing special citation events,
      which will serve as an alternative or addition to the normal footnotes.
    </P>

    <P class="mb-3">
      Correctly displaying such papers, integrating citations, and allowing them
      to be reviewed (with kind 1111 comments), and annotated (with highlights)
      by users, is the focus of the second minor version, Euler.
    </P>

    <P class="mb-3">
      Euler will also pioneer the HTTP-based (rather than websocket-based)
      e-paper compatible version of the web app.

    <P class="mb-3">
      An example of a research paper is <A
        href="/publication?d=less-partnering-less-children-or-both-by-julia-hellstrand-v-1"

    <Heading tag="h3" class="h-leather mb-3">For wiki pages</Heading>

    <P class="mb-3">
      Alexandria now supports wiki pages (kind 30818), allowing for
      collaborative knowledge bases and documentation. Wiki pages, such as this
      one about the <A href="/publication?d=sybil">Sybil utility</A> use the same
      Asciidoc format as other publications but are specifically designed for interconnected,
      evolving content.
    </P>

    <P class="mb-3">
      Wiki pages can be linked to from other publications and can contain links
      to other wiki pages, creating a web of knowledge that can be navigated and
      explored.

// AI-NOTE: To maintain good key security practices, Alexandria will not work with private keys in
// server-side code. This file offers a subset of authentication functionality that can be safely
// run on the server. For now, this is limited to read-only public key authentication. The server
// will not sign events or authorize into relays on the user's behalf.

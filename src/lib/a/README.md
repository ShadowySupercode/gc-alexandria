# Component Library

This folder contains a component library. 
The idea is to have project-scoped reusable components that centralize theming and style rules, 
so that main pages and layouts focus on the functionalities.

All components are based on Flowbite Svelte components,
which are built on top of Tailwind CSS. 

Keeping all the styles in one place allows us to easily change the look and feel of the application by switching themes.

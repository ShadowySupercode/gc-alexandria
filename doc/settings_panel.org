* Settings Panel Documentation

** Overview
The settings panel controls how events are fetched and displayed in the visualization. It has several sections that work together to create an efficient and user-friendly experience.

** Event Types Configuration

*** Purpose
Controls which types of Nostr events are fetched and how many of each type.

*** Key Event Types
- *Kind 30040* (Index Events): Publication indices
- *Kind 30041* (Content Events): Publication content
- *Kind 30818* (Content Events): Alternative content format
- *Kind 30023* (Content Events): Alternative content format

*** How Limits Work
Each event kind has a limit number that controls different things:

**** For Kind 0 (Profiles)
- Limit controls how many profiles to fetch from discovered pubkeys
- These profiles are used for:
  - Displaying names instead of pubkeys
  - Showing profile pictures in tooltips
  - When "People" tag anchors are selected, this limit controls how many people anchors to display

**** For Kind 3 (Follow Lists)  
- =limit = 1=: Only fetch the current user's follow list
- =limit > 1=: Fetch the user's follow list PLUS (limit-1) follow lists from people they follow
- The depth selector controls traversal:
  - =Direct= (0): Just the immediate follows
  - =2 degrees= (1): Follows of follows
  - =3 degrees= (2): Three levels deep

**** For Kind 30040/30041/30818
- Limit controls maximum number of these events to fetch

** Tag Anchors

*** What Are Tag Anchors?
Tag anchors are special nodes in the graph that act as gravity points for events sharing common attributes. They help organize the visualization by grouping related content.

*** Tag Types Available
- *Hashtags* (t): Groups events by hashtag
- *Authors*: Groups events by author
- *People* (p): Shows people from follow lists as anchor points
- *Event References* (e): Groups events that reference each other
- *Titles*: Groups events by title
- *Summaries*: Groups events by summary

*** How People Tag Anchors Work
When "People" is selected as the tag type:

1. The system looks at all loaded follow lists (kind 3 events)
2. Extracts all pubkeys (people) from those follow lists
3. Creates tag anchors for those people (up to the kind 0 limit)
4. Connects each person anchor to:
   - Events they authored (where pubkey matches)
   - Events where they're mentioned in "p" tags

*** Display Limiting and Auto-Disable
- Tag anchors are created for ALL discovered tags
- But only displayed up to the configured limit
- When > 20 tag anchors exist, they're all auto-disabled
- Users can selectively enable specific anchors
- The legend becomes scrollable for many anchors

*** "Only show people with publications" Checkbox
When checked (default):
- Only shows people who have events in the current visualization
  
When unchecked:
- Shows ALL people from follow lists, even if they have no events displayed
- Useful for seeing your complete social graph

** Display Limits Section

*** Max Publication Indices (30040)
Controls display filtering for publication indices after they're fetched.

*** Max Events per Index  
Limits how many content events to show per publication index.

*** Fetch if not found
When enabled, automatically fetches missing referenced events.

** Graph Traversal Section

*** Search through already fetched
When enabled, tag expansion only searches through events already loaded (more efficient).

*** Append mode
When enabled, new fetches add to the existing graph instead of replacing it.

** Current Implementation Questions

1. *Profile Fetching*: Should we fetch profiles for:
   - Only event authors?
   - All pubkeys in follow lists?
   - All pubkeys mentioned anywhere?

2. *People Tag Anchors*: Should they connect to:
   - Only events where the person is tagged with "p"?
   - Events they authored?
   - Both?

3. *Display Limits*: Should limits control:
   - How many to fetch from relays?
   - How many to display (fetch all, display subset)?
   - Both with separate controls?

4. *Auto-disable Threshold*: Is 20 the right number for auto-disabling tag anchors?

** Ideal User Flow

1. User loads the visualization
2. Their follow list is fetched (kind 3, limit 1)
3. Profiles are fetched for people they follow (kind 0, respecting limit)
4. Publications are fetched (kind 30040/30041/30818)
5. User enables "People" tag anchors
6. Sees their follows as anchor points
7. Can see which follows have authored content
8. Can selectively enable/disable specific people
9. Can increase limits to see more content/people

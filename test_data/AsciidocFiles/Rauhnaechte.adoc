.The first mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *January*
Namesake: *Anastasia*
Theme: *From darkness into light*

The first Rauhnacht is dedicated to the month of January, carrying the energy of Anastasia, "the one who rises." It symbolizes emerging from darkness into light and invites reflection on your foundation. Strengthen your roots—what is the state of your earthly grounding, and what does it rest upon?

* Honor and bless your roots while contemplating what aspects of your life or lineage need healing.
* Consider what is needed to find peace and balance.
* Remember, true prosperity (Wohlstand) means "to stand well" (wohl stehen).
* Light a candle for your ancestors and carry its glow into your dreams.
* Leave a gift for nature at the roots of a tree, offering it along with good wishes to your ancestors. Take your questions into your dreams — answers may come... sometimes takes time over three nights and days. Write down what you receive, for the messages may guide your steps into the light.

== The Second Rauhnacht

December 25th to 26th

Month: *February*
Namessake: *St. Stephen*
Theme: *guidance and spiritual connection*

The second Rauhnacht connects to the month of February and resonates with the energy of St. Stephen, symbolizing guidance and spiritual connection.

This night invites you to return to your spiritual home, a sacred space within, where you are connected to the Source. Strengthen your bond with your higher self, knowing you are supported and accompanied by beings of light.

* Visit your inner sanctuary through meditation, stillness, or guided journeys to uncover what is essential for the times ahead. Who or what will accompany you into the new year?
* Reflect on guides such as masters, angels, spirit animals, plants, minerals, or elements that resonate with you.
* What still seeks resolution or healing?
* Consider the relationships you wish to nurture.
* Write down any insights or symbols you receive.
* You may also create a small medicine pouch filled with meaningful tokens. Lastly, ask for the clarity to hear your inner voice more distinctly as you move forward.

If you desire support for this inner journey, please feel free to reach out.

== The Third Rauhnacht

December 26th to 27th 

image::https://i.nostr.build/WG1m4uymsIlwYtNd.jpg[3rd Rauchnacht, 300]

.The third mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *March*
Theme: *God's grace and unconditional love*
Namesake: *St. John*

The third Rauhnacht corresponds to the month of March and is associated with St. John (Johannes), symbolizing God's grace and unconditional love.

This night invites you to open your heart and allow miracles into your life. In March, nature prepares for breakthroughs and renewal – just as you can release old burdens to make space for something new.

Ask yourself:

* Who was there for me during difficult times? Who brought love, joy, or wise advice into my life?
* To whom did I offer my friendship and affection?
* Are there relationships that drain my energy or feel out of balance?
* Which connections do I want to strengthen, and which can I loosen?

Take this opportunity to resolve old matters and open your heart anew through forgiveness and release.

Breathe deeply in and out, and imagine your heart opening like a flower, allowing unconditional love to flow into you. Only by accepting and loving yourself can you truly love others. Recognize your own light and inner beauty – this is the key to experiencing miracles.

Today, take time to formulate your wishes and goals for the new year. Focus on what brings you deep joy, love, and passion, as these are signposts guiding you to your soul's purpose. Create a vision board or write and draw your dreams, lighting a candle for each wish. Finally, hand your heartfelt desires over to the universe with trust, and open yourself
to the miracles that await.

== The Fourth Rauhnacht

December 27th to 28th

image::https://i.nostr.build/Xf6xIjIJOiN47CW9.jpg[4th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The fourth mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *April*
Theme: *release and transformation and Innocent Children*

The fourth Rauhnacht corresponds to the month of April and symbolizes release and transformation. It is the Day of the Innocent Children and reminds us that sometimes the old tries to suppress or even destroy the new – whether through past actions, experiences, or personal patterns. Today is a powerful time to clear the past and set the stage for a positive new year.

* Take some time to write down everything from the past that has burdened you, such as arguments, bad news, or nightmares.
* On a new piece of paper, reframe all the negative experiences into positive ones. Rewrite your story in a way that serves you and supports your well-being.
* Burn the first paper with the negative experiences as a symbolic act of release.
* Use visualization to transform: Imagine a violet flame flowing through and around your negative experiences, purifying and harmonizing them according to the divine plan. Feel how the negative energy shifts into positive energy. Visualize joy and gratitude as you see this transformation unfold. Hold the vision of your new images and allow white-golden light to flood through them, blessing and energizing your new vision.

Finally, light a candle for your guides of light, whether an angel, master, or other beings. This light presence will accompany you throughout the coming year.

Let go, trust that harmony is restored, and know that your new path is set.

== The Fifth Rauhnacht

December 28th to 29th

image::https://i.nostr.build/Aj9U3RTjii4s9u4f.jpg[5th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The fifth mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *May*
Theme: *Friendship*
Namesake: *Thomas*

The fifth Rauhnacht corresponds to the month of May and honors the feast day of Thomas, meaning "Twin." This night, therefore, is about the soul's twin.

The theme of this night is friendship – with yourself and with others. True friendships hold the quiet secret of deep connection. Take time to ask yourself: Am I my own best friend? Forgive yourself and be kind to yourself. Only by offering love and understanding to yourself can you extend it to others.

* Reflect on the friendships in your life. Which ones enrich you? Are there broken connections that need healing? What would it take to find peace and resolution? Clearing the field can create space for new, meaningful friendships and experiences of love.
* Look back at the past year: What have you done well? Where were the highs and lows, the setbacks and successes? Speak to yourself as you would to your best friend, and say "Yes" to yourself.
* If there are people you wish to release energetically, visualize the infinity symbol. Imagine yourself standing in one circle and the other person in the opposite circle. See their light and become aware of all the connections formed between you over time. Ask a light being, an angel, or divine light to gently dissolve any heavy or unhealthy bonds. Visualise that both of you are wrapped in light as the infinity symbol softly separates in the center. The circles move apart until the distance feels light, comfortable, and harmonious for both. Thank the person for the love and shared experiences. Everything comes to a good end.
* Perhaps you’d like to tell your friends how much you love and appreciate them. This can be done through a letter, a phone call, or a heartfelt gesture. It's a beautiful way to celebrate connection and gratitude.

== The Sixth Rauhnacht

December 29th to 30th

image::https://i.nostr.build/vvqa4EDyGh5O48Ab.png[6th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The sixth mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *June*
Theme: *Purification*

The sixth Rauhnacht is dedicated to the month of June and the theme of purification. This night is about letting go and looking ahead with confidence — expect the best! What do you want to leave behind from the old year? Take some time to reflect on the past year and consciously prepare for the transition into the new one. Today is also a beautiful opportunity to connect with your family.

* Begin by reaching out to the soul of your mother and asking her for a gift to take into the new year. Form your hands into a bowl and receive this gift with gratitude.
* Then, connect with the soul of your father and do the same. These gifts come from the highest realm of love.
* If you have a partner, ask their soul for a gift and, in return, offer them one from your own highest love.
* If you have children, bestow gifts upon them from this sacred space as well. These gifts will accompany you and your family through the year ahead.
* Find a quiet and safe space to connect with your spirit. Reflect on the past year:
** What went well, and what did not?
** What do you wish to leave behind?
** Are there matters that still need cleansing or healing?
** What do you need to release fully so it no longer weighs you down?
* Write down your thoughts and burn the paper in a flame, ideally with white sage or incense (Olibanum), as a symbolic act of letting go.
* Additionally, clear your home of anything broken, unnecessary, or associated with negative feelings. By doing so, you create space for new energy and opportunities to enter your life.

== The Seventh Rauhnacht

December 30th to 31st

image::https://i.nostr.build/vZjzmGs2eTxUxA3g.jpg[7th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The seventh mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *July*
Theme: *Preparation for what’s to come*
Namesake: *Silvester*

The seventh Rauhnacht, associated with the month of July and the namesake _Silvester_, carries the theme of _Preparation for What’s to Come._

It represents the gateway — the transition from a past phase into a new one. Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, this transition has been celebrated by many on December 31st, a day dedicated to the Roman bishop Silvester. His death commemorates the end of Christian persecution and the establishment of Christianity as a state religion. (For spiritual insights on Christ consciousness, I recommend https://njump.me/naddr1qvzqqqr4gupzp35mw8w9vn7ux59vmhle98e96usz4s28pjr53psgh4ke3epxhfmrqyvhwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnndehhyapwwdhkx6tpdshszythwden5te0dehhxarj9emkjmn99uqp2d3ctaynzefcvex5vamxvf04sunzfu6nqdgtaz38t[this article I recently shared]).

Every transition holds the opportunity to change, reshape, and perceive life with fresh eyes. Use this day to prepare for the new year:

* Symbolically wash away the old — whether through bathing, showering, or a cleansing ritual—and visualize your wishes and dreams for the year ahead.
* Celebrate the transition in the circle of your loved ones, as the circle symbolizes unity and wholeness.
* This night is also about banishing unwanted energies. Cleanse your space with smudging tools such as sage or frankincense to dispel negativity. *Important: Smudge before midnight to avoid sweeping away the good fortune of the new year.*
* Set new, meaningful intentions and reflect on the past year: What have you accomplished, and what remains unresolved?
* Share a plate of food with the nature spirits by offering it at the roots of a tree to show your gratitude and strengthen their goodwill.
* New Year’s Eve is also a perfect time for oracle rituals, such as drawing cards, lead pouring, or pendulum readings.
* Wish your loved ones a peaceful, joyful, and healthy transition into the new year.

This is also an ideal time to nurture your health and well-being. Rather than losing yourself in the hustle of crowds or indulging in excess, choose a more mindful approach — it will give you a strong and joyful start to the year.

Fireworks were created to distract us from our inner processes. Smudging, on the other hand, brings you back to the present moment, centers you, and deepens your connection to your soul.

#Much love to all of you, and heartfelt thanks for being together in this! It truly means so much to me.#

== The Eighth Rauhnacht

December 31st to January 1st

image::https://i.nostr.build/2zCdzjOFRGb8ASLs.jpg[8th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The eighth mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *August*
Theme: *Birth of the New Year*

#Good fortune and blessings on all your paths.#

This eighth Rauhnacht is dedicated to new beginnings and blessings. It is a time to welcome the New Year with celebration and set it on a path filled with happiness and positivity.

* Bless the New Year by lighting candles — the glow invites good fortune and symbolizes the start of a fresh, fulfilling cycle. If you feel the need, you can also use incense to cleanse and harmonize the energy in your home.
* Remember: How you begin today will accompany you throughout the entire year. Make this day meaningful, whether through gratitude, loving connections, or powerful intentions for the year ahead.
* The dreams that visited you on New Year's Eve carry a special message. Take time to reflect on these dreams and write them down — they may hold guidance for the months to come.

#Wishing you all the best for this new year filled with wonders and opportunities! May it be blessed with happiness, love, and endless possibilities.#

== The Ninth Rauhnacht

January 1st to January 2nd

image::https://i.nostr.build/9YSicvZQYFdLIO7i.jpg[9th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The ninth mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *September*
Theme: *Gold, Blessing Light*
Rune of the Day: *Kenaz*
Namesakes: *Saint Katharina and Kaspar*

For many, January 2nd marks the return of everyday life.

Saint Katharina represents various aspects of the Earth Mother. Her symbol, the Wheel of Life, embodies the cycle of birth, life, and death. She brings the light and blesses the Sun Child with the gifts of life and wisdom. The wheel also symbolizes the belief that through faith, destiny and redemption can be achieved.

The name Kaspar means "treasurer" in Persian. He symbolizes gold, which he offers as a gift. Gold represents the perfection of the soul and the radiant purity of inner light. It lies at the center of the Wheel of Destiny, signifying harmony and balance. The light has been embodied, and it is perfect and complete.

image::https://i.nostr.build/V8Jfre0erMhpft7A.jpg[Rune Kenaz, 150,, role=right]
The Rune Kenaz, the sixth rune, is interpreted as a torch or flame. It symbolizes insight, wisdom, and inner fire. This rune embodies the power of transformation through light and knowledge. It reminds us that we are all bearers of light – this light resides in every cell and every atom of our being.

It is time to focus on your center and align yourself. In the center lies stillness, peace, and strength, from which all energy flows. Connect with the golden core within you.

.A small blessing meditation for the Ninth Rauhnacht
Use this night to connect with your inner light and golden core:

* _Light a Candle:_ The flame of the candle symbolizes a new beginning.
* _Sit in Stillness:_ Invite this light into your heart.
* _Visualize Golden Light:_ See this light flowing through your crown chakra into your heart and then radiating out through your hands.
* _Bless the New Year:_ Guide this golden stream of light through the 12 months of the year. Wrap each month in golden light, blessing it with love and intention.
* _Notice Your Sensations:_ Pay attention to the energy flow and your feelings during this meditation. Reflect on how each month feels as the light touches it.
* _Focus on Your Center:_ Reconnect with the inner peace and harmony within your core. From this place of stillness, let your strength for the year ahead grow.

May this night guide you to your light and remind you that the gold of perfection and wisdom already resides within you. Bless the new year with light, love, and the power of your inner flame.

== Tenth Rauhnacht

January 2nd to January 3rd

image::https://i.nostr.build/MjMet1uDZ6bVbjag.jpg[10th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The tenth mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *October*
Theme: *Frankincense, Visions and Insights, Connection to the Divine*
Namesakes: *Ehwaz, Ambeth-Margarete, Melchior*

January 3rd invites us to connect with our inner wisdom and divine inspiration.

image::https://i.nostr.build/46hv92Ay7WHJ4Wcr.jpg[Rune Ahwaz, 150,, role=left]
The Rune Ahwaz (or Ehwaz) stands for M and represents movement, development, and progress. It
reminds us that life is in constant flux, and through transformation, we grow.

Ambeth-Margarete embodies the nurturing mother, fertility, abundance, birth, and rebirth – filled with light, love, and goodness. She represents the spiral of life and the cauldron of abundance, offering us tireless strength and energy.

Melchior, the wise man from the East, brings frankincense to the crib. Frankincense symbolizes the life’s gold within us and our connection to the Divine.

This night calls us to reflect on our gifts, imagination, and life energy:

* How do I use my talents, thoughts, and creativity?
* How do I invest my life energy – in words, actions, and expression?
* What occupies most of my time?

Each day provides a new opportunity to realign yourself. Reflect:

* Which aspects of your life do you want to transform and improve?
* What changes do you wish to make this year? What steps can you take to bring them to life?
* Visualize your future: Create clear images in your mind of how you want to shape your life. 

#Every transformation begins within – it's in your hands.#

The only constant is change. Use the energy of this day to explore new perspectives and
align yourself with your vision for the months ahead.

== Eleventh Rauhnacht

January 3rd to January 4th

image::https://i.nostr.build/5MOsBHj4N3abJyWK.webp[11th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The eleventh mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *November*
Theme: *Letting Go, Farewells, Reflection on Death*
Namesake: *Berkana, Borbeth-Barbara, Balthasar*

This night invites us to pause and reflect on impermanence and the act of letting go.

image::https://i.nostr.build/e4eKs1vwkkxQ2cuc.webp[Rune Berkana, 150,, role=right]
The rune Berkana symbolizes fertility and the creative force of Mother Earth. It represents both birth and death, promising a peaceful and fruitful life in harmony with nature’s cycles. Borbeth-Barbara, whose name derives from the Earth goddess Borbeth, stands for severing life’s threads and releasing old ties. Her symbol, the tower, reflects strength and transition. The name "Borbeth" evokes words such as bed — a place of rest — prayer, and petition. Barbara signifies both the act of giving life and the bier upon which the deceased rest.

Balthasar, the wise man from the East, means _God protect his eternal life._ He brings myrrh, which was traditionally used for embalming the dead. Myrrh represents the transient nature of human life, reminding us that our time on Earth is finite.

Reflecting on life’s impermanence leads us to profound existential questions:

* Why am I here?
* What do I want to bring into this world?
* What is the purpose of my life?
* What goal am I pursuing during my time on Earth?

Center yourself to find stillness and clarity for realignment. Take time to think about death and the questions it raises. Death isn’t only the end of life but also manifests daily in goodbyes, transitions, and transformations.

Ask yourself:

* What has truly ended, and what needs to be let go of?
* Where do I feel trapped, and what do I want to free myself from?
* What is truly important to me, and how do I want to use my life energy?
* What legacy do I want to leave behind? What do I want to be said or written about me?

This night offers the chance to bring order to life, release old ties, and refocus on what truly matters. By consciously engaging with the act of letting go, you create space for new beginnings — laying the foundation for a meaningful and fulfilling life path.

== The Twelfth Rauhnacht

January 4th to January 5th

image::https://i.nostr.build/FcdIK0RWD3dzYI3N.jpg[12th Rauchnacht, 300]

.The twelfth mystical night of twelve
[%hardbreaks]
Month: *December*
Theme: *Cleansing and Purification*
Namesake: *The Three Holy Maidens – Day of Grace*

The twelfth Rauhnacht marks a time of closure and cleansing. The Three Holy Maidens, representing the sacred feminine in its various aspects, stand for grace, healing, and protection. They guide us during this night with their blessing, showing the path to inner and outer harmony.

Tonight offers you the opportunity to address and release anything that may not have gone well during the past 12 nights.

Take some time to reflect on the Rauhnächte:

* What has weighed on you?
* Which signs or experiences felt unsettling or uncomfortable?

This night is filled with unique power and energy. With focused reflection, you can align yourself with this special time and prepare for renewal.

In many places, Percht Processions are held, and old customs and traditions are celebrated. For example, the Three Kings Cake is traditionally baked on January 6th.

Another practice involves smudging hats, magical items, ritual tools, and healing stones to clear away old and burdensome energies.

During this night, strong forces are believed to converge, making it advisable not to spend too much time outdoors. It is said that dreams from this night have the power to come true.

.A ritual for this night
Before going to bed, smudge everything that is important to you and has been exposed to various energies:

* Your home’s entrance or door
* Your coat or shoes
* Your bedroom or other spaces

Go to sleep with the clear intention of feeling protected by beings of light as you journey through your dreamland.

This final Rauhnacht closes the cycle and prepares the way for the coming year — cleansed, blessed, and filled with positive energy.

#I hope you enjoyed this journey of the 12 Rauhnächte. I'd love to hear your opinion and reflections.#
